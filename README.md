# FleetFusion AI: Efficiency Through Intelligence  

FleetFusion AI leverages data from the India State Roads Transport Undertaking (SRTU) to analyze fleet efficiency, employment conditions, and accident statistics. This project identifies challenges in public transportation and truck driver welfare and provides actionable recommendations to improve fleet management, safety, and driver well-being.

---

## **Key Objectives**  
- **Fleet Efficiency**: Analyze fleet utilization, maintenance costs, and fuel efficiency.  
- **Driver Welfare**: Address issues like working hours, wages, and health benefits.  
- **Safety Insights**: Investigate accident trends and causes to propose preventive measures.  
- **Modernization Recommendations**: Suggest upgrades for vehicles and policies to improve sustainability and reduce costs.  

---

## **Key Insights**  

### **Fleet Efficiency**  
- **Utilization**: Average fleet utilization is ~89%, indicating opportunities for better management.  
- **Aging Fleets**: Some fleets are over 15 years old, increasing maintenance costs and risks.  

### **Driver Employment Trends**  
- Long working hours, low wages, and limited healthcare access exacerbate truck drivers' challenges.  

### **Safety Concerns**  
- Accident data highlights unsafe routes, driver fatigue, and outdated vehicles as critical concerns.  

---

## **Recommendations**  

1. **Modernize Fleets**:  
   - Replace outdated vehicles with modern, fuel-efficient, or electric alternatives.  

2. **Driver Training**:  
   - Conduct regular training sessions on road safety, vehicle maintenance, and digital tools.  

3. **Accident Prevention**:  
   - Enhance road infrastructure, introduce fatigue detection systems, and ensure safe rest areas.  

4. **Employment Policies**:  
   - Establish fair wages, regulated working hours, and access to healthcare benefits.
